__**Benchmarks**__
This section of the Solak guide aims to provide the current meta rotations and explain additional strategies for the smoothest kills possible for both duo and 4 man kills. To give an idea of the kill speeds assumed with these strategies, below is a list of benchmarks to aim for:
⬥ Overall, expect ~6:20 duo and ~5:40 4 man kill times.
    • P1 Root Skip
    • P1 1 Cycle Core (1CC)
    • P2 SE Erupt Skip (killing both southern eruptions before being cleansed)
    • P2 Climb Skip (4 man only)
    • P2 2nd Rain Skip (duo only)
    • P3 2 Pad 
    • P3 1 Cycle Elf (duo only)
    • P4 No-Realm (NR)

*Note: this guide will NOT cover rotations/tips for storm tanking P2. While storm tanking can speed up kills by as much as 10+ seconds, the risk involved is generally considered too high to be worth it for overall kills per hour.*

.
> __**Overview of roles**__
.tag:roles
__**Duo:**__
⬥ Base: Bleeds first P1, stays down P2, uses all bleeds P3.
⬥ DPS: ZGS specs first P1, goes up twice P2

*Note: The above roles are not mutually exclusive to any other bleed usage (i.e. either player can bleed elf/pre-bleed P4).*

__**Pre-fight**__
⬥ Overload on these incense sticks:
    • Spirit Weed <:SpiritSticks:565726489136463894>
    • Lantadyme <:LantaSticks:565726489404899368>
    • Kwuarm <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> (optional)
⬥ Overload at bank <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532>
    • 1 dose should last the entire kill with Lantadyme incense sticks.
⬥ Build adrenaline and DBA Spec <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>

.
> __**Phase 1:**__
.tag:p1
__**Summary**__
⬥ **Phase 1 Start**
    • Before starting, the base should use an ability such as Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> or Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to signal to the DPS that they are about to engage Solak.
    • All players do a Berserk Limitless <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation, followed by a ZGS Special Attack <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> rotation.
        - Use Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> and Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> in both rotations.
        - Bleed the Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> in the Berserk rotation only.
    • Base uses bleeds with Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> between Zerk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and ZGS Special Attack <:zgs:626465964325601290> rotations.
    • DPS uses bleeds with Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> after the ZGS Special Attack <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> rotation.
    • Everyone builds to 100% adrenaline for Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> around ~55 second mark.
*Note: It is generally a good idea to walk Solak south at the beginning of the fight until he is roughly in the centre of the arena. This makes it so pads are easier to Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to and from.*
    • Kill roots according to the diagram below.
.

.
⬥ **Roots**
    • Duo:
        - After using Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> the base should place mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> on the southernmost root on the west side.
        - DPS should use Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> then place mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> on the northernmost root on the east side.
        - Everyone then uses Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> back to Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and kill the un-mined roots assigned to them according to the diagram above.
    • 4 Man:
        - Base and 2 DPS should Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> in the usual duo spot and kill Northwest and Southeast roots.
        - The other DPS should Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> on the east side and kill the East and Northeast roots.
    • Reminders:
        - Roots can be stunned/bound.
        - Any roots outside of Sunshine range should be killed with melee.
        - Roots heal in a clockwise pattern so make sure the root anticlockwise to them is dead if any are going to be left alive.

*Note: Roots should only be targeted after Solak has hit phase 1 hp cap (2.25m hp for duos, 3.75m hp for 4 man). If he is above the HP cap, he will do the roots spec (marked tile with timer) at 1:06 on the boss timer. If the cap has been hit, he will phase into arms/legs.*
.
⬥ **Arms/Legs**
    • All sizes:
        - Stand in the Dbreath spot in the diagram above.
        - Use mage and abuse AoEs like Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>.
        - Ignore any lasher spawns if roots dont die since it will disrupt other people's rotations if you deviate.
        - As the legs are about to die, all players should Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> + Apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, then Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to finish the legs off.
    • Duo:
        - Base targets far arm.
        - DPS targets close arm.
    • 4 Man:
        - Everyone targets whichever arm is closest to them.
⬥ **Core**
    • Vuln bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> the core and and use <:assault:535532853979512842>, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, and Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> as thresholds along with good basics.
    
*Note: Stand under the core to guarantee that Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> will do correct flanking damage.

.
> __**Phase 2:**__
.tag:p2
__**Summary**__
⬥ **Eruptions**
    • All sizes:
        - After killing the core, all players should switch to mage and kill the Southwestern eruption, activating cleanse (clicking on Merethial) after your 3rd ability.
        - Finish killing the Southwestern eruption, get cleansed, and go up the storm via the Southwest circle. The team should then evenly split the 2 northern eruptions, with half the team going up a second time to finish killing the storm.
        - Base does not go up a second time to kill the storm.
    • Duo:
        - Decide before the fight who is going to take which Northern eruption.
    • 4 man:
        - People doing the Elf 1 role should go up a second time to kill the storm.
        - People doing the Elf 2 role stay down after killing the Northern eruption.
        
*Note: Switch to melee for Northern eruptions.*

.
⬥ __**After Eruptions**__
    • Duo:
        - Base should start with a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> rotation, followed by a Berserk Limitless <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation (or vice versa depending on aggro), and finally a ZGS Special Attack <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> rotation.
        - DPS should sigil zerk after coming down, sun and ZGS spec. The DPS should climb during the arm spec. 

    • 4 man:
        - Base and Elf 2 roles should start with a Berserk Limitless <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation, followed by a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> rotation.
        - Elf 1 roles should do a Berserk Limitless <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation, then do a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> rotation, then use thresholds until phased.
        
*Note: Make sure adrenaline is high as Phase 2 ends so you can start Phase 3 with a Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> rotation.

.
__**Duo:**__

If Solak is on the DPS, the Base should <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and use flanking <:impact:535533809655873556> before Solak reaggros. Within this sun you should aim to get 2x <:wm:535533809978966037>, 1x <:asphyx:535533833072672778> and 1x <:deto:535533833358016512>. Note that you should freely use all bleeds here, as the DPS will be zerking after coming down from the storm. After the second <:wm:535533809978966037> build to 100 adren, <:zerk:535532854004678657> and do the same <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation as P1 (bled <:assault:535532855191928842> + <:cane:535532878969438210>). Your <:zerk:535532854004678657> should be over before the start of rain spec. After <:zerk:535532854004678657>, use all TMW bleeds (<:mwspear:694566917456789554> + <:dismember:535532879376023572> <:slaughter:535532879237873666> <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>), then <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>. Optimally, this should be happening just a few abilities before the arms spec, so you should be able to <:anti:535541306475151390> and <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> (remember to <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> out of MD to prevent auto) . Regardless, use <:assault:535532855191928842> + <:cane:535532878969438210> and 188s in ZGS to bring Solak to the phase HP. Make sure your adren is high at this time, to be able to <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> ASAP at the start of P3. If Solak is on you, use TMW bleeds (<:mwspear:694566917456789554> + <:dismember:535532879376023572> <:slaughter:535532879237873666> <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>) first, then build to zerk. Sun afterwards with the same thresholds mentioned before, then ZGS.

.
The DPS should zerk when they come down from the storm, doing the same rotation as P1 (bled  <:assault:535532855191928842> + <:cane:535532878969438210>). Afterwards, do a sun rotation similar to the base, aiming to get 2x <:wm:535533809978966037>, 1x <:asphyx:535533833072672778> and 1x flanking <:deep:535533833139912724>. <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> when you are around 80 adren after the second <:wm:535533809978966037>. Due to the fact that the DPS goes up twice, you have less time for <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> P2, which generally means it’s better to <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> without barging, and <:freedom:535541258240786434> for arms. Your rotation here can vary a bit, though, so just use your own judgement and above all make sure you are giving yourself enough time to <:bd:535532854281764884> to + climb the arm. Whilst climbing, you will not be able to melee Solak, so switch to mage and build until he phases. If the HP is quite high at this point, you can use thresholds. Note that you should try to avoid using mage autos around when Solak phases here, as you will end up stalling any autos you use during the phase transition (this forces your next auto to be a mage auto regardless of weapon type, so you will be unable to 5taa in your P3 <:zerk:535532854004678657>). 

.
__**4-Man:**__
P2 damage is a bit more important in 4 man kills, since you are not timegated by the arm spec. If Solak is aggro’d on either of the elf 1’s, the base and elf 2 should use mage thresholds and the base should <:voke:535541259465392143> + (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> before building to <:zerk:535532854004678657> (mage thresholds can be skipped if low on adrenaline). The base and elf 1 should <:gbarge:535532879250456578> with mobile <:mob:689501908628799488> (use either Excalibur or mage armor) on their erupt so that it is back for <:zerk:535532854004678657>. If Solak is aggro’d on base or elf 1, the base can instantly <:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:slaughter:535532879237873666> + <:comb:535533833098100745>, then build to <:zerk:535532854004678657>. 

The elf 1’s essentially do the exact same rotation as the DPS in a duo, except the ZGS at the end of the phase should be skipped. Sigil <:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:zerk:535532854004678657> (same rotation as P1) and <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.

The base should make sure to always apply (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:slaughter:535532879237873666> + <:dismember:535532879376023572> between ults. On a good kill this means that generally the base (and often the elf 2 as well) will not have enough time to get a good ZGS off, if this is the case, simply continue using thresholds in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and <:cane:535532878969438210>/<:gflurry:535532879283879977> afterwards (the base should, again, use TMW bleeds).

.
> __**Phase 3:**__
.tag:p3
__**Summary:**__
⬥ **Phase 3 Start**
    • All sizes:
        - Everyone starts with Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> + Apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, then bleed either Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> and fully channel Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>, or vice versa.
    • Duo:
        - Don't lure to any pads until Solak has ~580k hp.
        - Both players do a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> rotation after Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> is finished.
        - Both players go in to fight Erethdor with a ZGS Special Attack <:zgs:626465964325601290> rotation when Solak has <350k hp.
    • 4 Man:
        - Don't lure to any pads until Solak has ~1.1m hp.
        - Elf 1s go in to fight Erethdor with a ZGS Special Attack <:zgs:626465964325601290> rotation while the Elf 2 and Base keep fighting Solak
        - Elf 2 goes in to finish killing Erethdor when Solak has <750k hp.

*Note: Only one player should use Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> for bleeds while killing Erethdor.*

.
During the phase transition to P4, if already not at 100 adrenaline, there is time to use 2 defensives and <:zerk:535532854004678657>. All players <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, and bleed assault and channel destroy (or vice versa). Remember to 5taa to not lose any ticks of <:zerk:535532854004678657> here. The DPS(s) can use <:gfury:535532879334080527> and flanking <:backhand:535532854302605333> and the base can use <:freedom:535541258240786434> to fill out their respective zerk rotations. Near the beginning of the phase, the base should also position Solak such that he is south of the northernmost pad. This is to make it easier for the base to flank in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, which can be done when Solak does his seizure animation while charging pads. Solak should begin to seize after the first ability out of <:zerk:535532854004678657>.

.
__**Duo**__
In duo the first pad is ignored. The base should (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:dismember:535532879376023572>, then <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. The DPS should sun on the northern wall to easily flank and also avoid Solak’s stun. The base should <:slaughter:535532879237873666> in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at some point and lure Solak to the 2nd pad at around **580k** HP (can be lower if uncomfortable). Both players enter the elf when the HP is at most **350k** (you can also just decide with your duo partner what kind of P4 HP you are both comfortable with), and proceed to barge + ZGS. Both players will bleed <:assault:535532853979512842> and flank at some point depending on when the other player <:voke:535541259465392143>. One player should use (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:dismember:535532879376023572>, <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>, and <:cane:535532878969438210>, while the other should use <:cane:535532878969438210> and <:gflurry:535532879283879977>. Note that Erethdor is capable of using <:freedom:535541258240786434> on <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, so it should not be used. 

.
__**4-Man:**__
The elf 1’s should use <:wm:535533809978966037> after their <:zerk:535532854004678657>s, then use defensives and enter the elf. The rotations used in the elf should be more adren conservative as both elf 1’s will need to sun immediately when they come out. Something similar to bleed <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:assault:535532853979512842> **OR** bleed <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:mwspear:694566917456789554> + <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → <:cane:535532878969438210> is fine. After elf, the elf 1’s should <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> in the same spots as in a duo - one southwest, but east of the base (so as to not hit the base with roots), and one on the northern wall. The base and elf 2 do essentially the exact same rotations as in a duo, except Solak can be lured to the pad much earlier (1.1m is generally safe to start charging).

.
> __**Phase 4:**__
.tag:p4
```Summary:
Remember to shard while Solak is immune to damage (but attackable). The timing for zerking P4 is 5 abilities + 2t, then zerk. Provided nobody on the team has died, sigil zerk with a bled assault, hurricane, and flurry (or shatter and destroy) from all players will easily finish off Solak.```

.
In duo and 4 man the rotations are exactly the same. If you are able to build to 100 adrenaline before Solak is attackable, Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> can be used. To build back to 100 adrenaline in time, use <:nat:535541258131865633> (with 2H auto) → <:StormShards:536256663641128971> → 5TAA + basic → basic (<:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:dismember:535532879376023572> if base) → defensive → <:zerk:535532854004678657>. With <:nat:535541258131865633> active during P4, you will be able to use a <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> instead of your 3rd threshold, so something like <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → bleed <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:cane:535532878969438210>/<:destroy:535532879330148352> depending on HP (<:Shatter:536256673904328704> beforehand if base).

If Solak’s starting HP is high in this phase, you can stall <:cane:535532878969438210> (<:Shatter:536256673904328704> if base) in the middle of your zerk and release the tick before <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (<:cane:535532878969438210>/<:destroy:535532879330148352> if base). This will make it so that Solak’s HP is higher for longer, which makes manifestations spawn slower (manifestations in the mind spawn faster as Solak’s corporeal HP decreases). Remember to cast <:Veng:543478434953822208>, turn on the Wrath prayer, call + manually target your Ripper Demon on Solak (as killing elf often causes Ripper to lose its target), and deploy Dreadnips if bringing them. With all these safeguards, it should be relatively easy to finish off Solak without dying on starting health pools of up to **350k** in duo or **570k** in 4 man.
