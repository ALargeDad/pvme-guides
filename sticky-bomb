.tag:sticky
**__General__**
⬥ Phase Telos to hp cap then run into the appropriate font.
⬥ Once font is depleted click on sticky bomb and use the right click option on middle golem. Don't drop sticky yet.
⬥ Throw the first sticky bomb when you get the popup message `You dare defy me?`
⬥ Throw the second sticky bomb directly beyond the first sticky bome when you get the popup message `Telos is preparing to fire an anima bomb!`
⬥ When you barge and start damaging telos, put yourself in a direct line beyond the minions and the sticky bombs so they stay in line and run into the next sticky bomb rather than dispersing and running around the bomb.
*Note: there are pre-barge and non pre-barge strategies to damage telos between fonts. This section will have examples showing pre-barge.*

.
__**Font 1**__
⬥ Starting at the red circle drawn in the font, you will simply barge telos and do damage until he reaches the next hp cap to trigger the 2nd font.

⬥ Font 1 sticky bomb example:

⬥In some cases telos can seem quite far from 1st font, however that doesn't matter and same strategy can be applied.
Font 1 Standard sticky, but telos being far away.

.
__**Font 2**__
⬥ Starting at the red circle drawn in this picture, you will run down to the corner near the font and do a couple defensives while waiting to enter the font. Once minions stack up near you, you can enter the font and they will be nicely stacked 2-3 golems wide. Rushing into the font can cause golems to be 4 units wide which makes it so one of them cannot be trapped by a sticky bomb.

⬥ Here is the spot in relation to the font you should wait to stack up minions:

*Note: The player did a faster font 2 method where they went straight into the font, then ran out to the waiting spot to line up minions, and then back in. The safest way is to go directly to the wait spot and let minions stack there.*

.
__**Font 3**__
⬥ The safest strategy for font 3 is to utilize the wrap-around method, so starting at the red circle drawn in this picture, you will follow the pathing of the red arrows and throw a sticky bomb
⬥ Once hp reaches 37,500 immediately throw a sticky bomb at the corner of the giant anima pool while running as indicated on this picture:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/MT2lKdi.jpg
    • The sticky bomb here makes it so the golems get stuck and cannot hit you while you wait for the font 3 golems to line up in front of you.
⬥ Hug the right-hand wall of the giant anima pool in that picture and wait for font 3 golems to get in front of you, then bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> behind the last golem in line.
    • After you bladed dive, target cycle Ingenuity of the Humans <:ingen:641339234111848463> Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> (either via borrowed power or spellbook swap) the last golem in line, then enter the third font. The minions should be stuck there long enough for you to finish Phase 4.

> __**Phase 5**__
.tag:Phase5

__**General**__
⬥ Throwing a bomb changes the direction your character faces, which determines which way you will surge while clearing virus, so the order you throw the bombs does matter on this phase.
    • Starting on side beam, you want to throw your first sticky bomb in front of telos, towards the direction you spawned on Phase 5, and then you throw your second sticky bomb alongside telos between you and the back beam. This changes the direction you face to be towards the backbeam so if you surge you'll go behind telos, and be able to bladed dive into the other beam.
        • If you were to reverse the order of sticky bombs thrown, your surge would take you backwards towards the spawn point and minions will be able to run around your sticky bomb and catch up to you unexpectedly.
⬥ The timing for sticky bombs on Phase 5 are as follows:
    • Sticky #1: when you bleed assault
    • Sticky #2: when you do your 3rd claw special (2nd to last ability before changing beams/clearing virus)
⬥ If Telos still has a good amount of hp left when you clear virus, keep throwing sticky bombs between where you are and where minions will be running to in order to permanently have them stuck while you finish the phase.
.
__**Backbeam Green**__
⬥ You want to throw the sticky bomb to the side of telos before using the last claws ability. 
⬥ You want to bladed dive to the appropriate side beam during the global cooldown after your last claws special attack.
    • Bladed diving 2 ticks after activating your last claws special attack lets you fully channel the special attack, and will allow you to immediately use your next ability rather than being stuck waiting for the global cooldown to finish.
⬥ Back beam to side beam example with red virus:

__**Sidebeam Green With Either Back or Opposite Side Beam Virus**__
⬥ Follow general Phase 5 sticky bomb setup. 
     • If you are confident in yourself you can wait to see what virus you got and decide to skip one of the bombs depending on whether you need to go to back beam or side beam, but it is good practice to do both bombs to be safe.

> __**Introduction**__
.tag:Introduction

⬥ Sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> is a bomb potion, that can be thrown to create a 3x3 area for 6 seconds, which binds monsters stood in it. The cast range of bomb is 9 tiles. The monsters are bind immuene for one step after the bind expires. 
⬥ There is a 3 tick delay before sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> lands once it's thrown out. That means you need to pre-emptively throw out sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964>bombs and plan ahead.
⬥ Sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> strategies are vital for Melee telos, as they're the main reason you're not tanking all the golems. (where as mage has ice-spells <:icebarrage:537340400185245701>)
⬥ For fonts it's important that consequetive stickies are touching, as they make it so golems can't accidently escape. 
⬥ Sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> forces telos to freedom.


> __**Phase 4**__
.tag:Phase4

> __**Font 1**__
.tag:Font1
⬥ You start phase 4 with 150,000 hp. Font 1 hp is 112,500 to 75,000. Run / Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> into font immediately once hp reaches 112,500, delaying running into font will delay his instant kill, thus making the kill slower.
⬥ Once font is depleted click on sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> and use the right click option on middle golem. Don't drop sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> yet.
⬥ When you see "You dare defy me?" drop the first sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964>. 
⬥ After the sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> lands (3 ticks after thrown), then throw the 2nd sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> out 2 tiles towards telos direction. Make sure sticky bombs <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> are touching to prevent golems from escaping.
⬥ Click on telos and barge around 3 ticks after throwing the 2nd sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> (right at start of him starting animation to get up) and bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> or walk back to font. (Hit-splat from barge will indicate this has been done correctly)
⬥ Bleed Destroy just as insta kill lands. This timing may differ depending on ping, so it's suggested to practice and find your timing.
⬥ Font 1 Standard: 

.img:https://imgur.com/0wEZsuW.mp4

⬥In some cases telos can seem quite far from 1st font, however that doesn't matter and same strategy can be applied.
Font 1 Standard, but telos is far.

> __**Font 2**__
.tag:Font2
⬥ Font 2 hp is 75,000 to 37,500
⬥ Fastest strategy utilises bd <:bd:535532854281764884> + surge <:surge:535533810004262912> towards font 2 right as you phase him from font 1.
⬥ In some cases when you run straight into font 2 the golems aren't in correct place to be lined up easily image example 

.img:https://imgur.com/ZRFvhYz.png

⬥ In that case the strategy would be to tank a tick of font damage, quickly run out for 1-2 ticks (enough for golems to chase), and run back in to time the 2nd font hit. 
⬥ Note rearranging golems is usually only required if doing fast Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, as golems spawn after you arrive at the destination. If you were to run to the font, then golems spawn before you arrive and re-arrange themselves by chasing you before you get into the font.
⬥ Font 2 rearranging golems example: 

.img:https://imgur.com/MU69zC7.mp4

⬥ Otherwise font 2 utilises the same strategy as font 1. Sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> on dare-defy me. Throw 2nd sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> 2 tiles away as the first one appears. 
⬥ Font 2 Standard Example: 

.img:https://imgur.com/wKCPF7q.mp4


> __**Font 3**__
.tag:Font3
⬥ Font 3 hp is 37,000 to 0
⬥ Safest strategy for font 3 is utilise the wrap around method, thus not needing to use stickies for the font itself.
⬥ Once hp reaches 37,500 immediately throw a sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> here 

.img:https://imgur.com/fngvVnk.png

⬥ That is so that the golems chasing you don't hit you when doing the wrap around if you're required to delay.
⬥ Once the golems reach the beam do BD <:bd:535532854281764884> -> target cycle +  Ingenuity of the Humans <:ingen:641339234111848463> + entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> (either via borrowed power <:borrowedpower:657248051190300682> or spellbook swap <:SBSStandards:565726489526534154>).
⬥ Once in font follow the standard rota to phase, no more sticky bombs <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> required.

> __**Phase 5**__
.tag:Phase5
⬥ The only situations you're required to utilise sticky bombs on Phase 5 is if you're unable to finish 200k by the time your barricade finishes.
⬥ There's two main examples of this, either you're bding from back beam to either side beam, or from side beam to the back beam.
⬥ There's a slightly different strategy if your virus is black beam, that is due to delaing lower dmg as you're not utilising red beam. Explanation is below.

> __**Backbeam**__
.tag:backbeam
⬥ You want to throw the sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> to the side of telos before using the last claw spec <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> . 
⬥ You want to Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the side while GCD is still on cooldown, so that you're able to finish telos in quick hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> + claws <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>. Using bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> whilist GCD is off cooldown will waste one global cooldown and make the kill slower. 

⬥ Back beam to side beam example with red virus: 

.img:https://imgur.com/EFwkfY0.mp4

> __**Sidebeam**__
.tag:sidebeam

⬥ Side beam sticky bombs <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> are used the same way as back beam, unless the virus is a black beam and golems are not clumped up.
⬥ If the virus is a black beam, then it's highly likely you will not instantly clear on virus and will need to kite using sticky bombs. If golems aren't clumped up then you will need to throw multiple bombs for virus clear. One sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> for golems far from telos, and one sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> for golems close to telos to also clear telos's freedom.
⬥ Throw the first sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> just before the last claw spec <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> one tile away from telos to trap the golems that are farther from telos. 
⬥ Throw the second sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> after your surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> combo, but this time make sure you hit telos as well with it to clear his freedom timing. The first sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> will ensure, that no golems get past and that they're lined up.
⬥ After clearing virus you want to use basics untill telos finished using 3 auto attacks after his freedom timing is cleared from the sticky bombs. After telos auto attacks 3 times, then you want to stun him and finish with claw spec <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.

⬥ Side beam to back beam: 
.img:https://imgur.com/qdvoS8n.mp4

⬥ Side beam is a bit simpler, as usually golems are clumped 2 tiles within telos and 1 sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> is sufficient.
